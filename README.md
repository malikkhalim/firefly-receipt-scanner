   ```

3. Edit the `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```
   # Firefly III API Configuration
   FIREFLY_III_URL=https://your-firefly-iii-instance.com
   FIREFLY_III_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token

   # Google AI API Configuration
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key
   ```
   
### Requesting Firefly III Token

   To use this application, you'll need a personal access token for Firefly III. Follow the instructions in the official documentation to generate one: [Firefly III API - Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/features/api/#personal-access-tokens)

### Requesting a Gemini API Key
   To use Google's Gemini AI, you'll need an API key. Visit the following URL to request one: [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

   You will be asked to enter a credit card for verification purposes, but personal usage will most likely fall within the free tier.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Image Processing Timeout**: If you receive a timeout error when processing an image, try using a clearer image with better lighting and less glare.
- **Transaction Creation Failed**: If transaction creation fails, check your Firefly III connection and ensure your API token has the necessary permissions.
- **Camera Not Working**: Ensure your browser has permission to access your camera. For mobile devices, you may need to use HTTPS.
